" And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this, we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process, to improve it and make it more accessible to people in the villages there. ",neutral,

" And I thought, well, maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer, you know: ""Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree."" And you might say, ""Well, God designed the cow.""But, of course, God got a lot of help. ",neutral,
 And so we need to be able to do the same thing. ,neutral,
" And the answer is, ""yes.""(Laughter)We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it. ",neutral,

" As an evolutionary biologist, I'd say this: our brains have evolved to help us survive within the orders of magnitude, of size and speed which our bodies operate at. ",neutral,
" Because as I started to say, I don't think you're given money or fame for your own ego, ever. ",neutral,
" Because Chris and his team have ensured that things are very, very high quality, right?",neutral,
 Because I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about that question. ,neutral,
 Because this is the way the food industry thought before Howard. ,neutral,
" Because with 50 funds to choose from, it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose, that you'll just put it off until tomorrow. ",neutral,
" Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you?",neutral,
 Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband. ,neutral,

 I never thought of it. ,neutral,
" I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address, and you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok?",neutral,
" I'm not going to spend too much time on that, but what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects that appear when an author publishes a book. ",neutral,
" I've been listening to the talks in the conference, and Robert Wright said yesterday that if we have an appreciation for another person's humanity, then they will have an appreciation for ours. ",neutral,
" If a relationship or business is not growing, if you're not growing, doesn't matter how much money or friends you have, how many love you, you feel like hell. ",neutral,
 Is he endorsing creationism here?,neutral,
 Is the information verifiable?,neutral,
" It is equally clear that the answer to the question is ""you."" You could have done better. ",neutral,
" It was the clever move of natural selection itself.Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA with Jim Watson, once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule. ",neutral,
" It's got a vacuum-formed, carbon-nylon pan. ",neutral,
" None of those figure into our cost, because first of all, we sell it at cost, and the governments distribute it. ",neutral,
 Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine?,neutral,
" Really simple.Howard does the experiment, and he gets the data back, and he plots it on a curve, and all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve. ",neutral,
 Shakespeare being seven?,neutral,
" So if I gonna be asked to put my life on the line, then front me the cash, man."" I think the gang member says it much more articulately than the economist, about what's going on.(Laughter)Here's another one. ",neutral,

" Thank you.Now, how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to?",neutral,
" That night is when 9/11 happened.One woman had come to the seminar, and when she came there, her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered. ",neutral,
" The answer is ""no."" It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.So, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things, the same explosion of choice is true. ",neutral,
" The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed.Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice, as this slide is meant to indicate. ",neutral,
" They put it in a little tiny glass jar, with a wonderful enameled label on it, made it look French, even though it's made in Oxnard, California.(Laughter)And instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight-ounce bottle, the way that French's and Gulden's did, they decided to charge four dollars.

" Well, the first thing is, there's a community of engineering professors, from Cambridge to Kyoto, who are developing engineering content in electrical engineering to develop what you can think of as a massive, super textbook that covers the entire area of electrical engineering. ",neutral,
" Well, this is from ""The Purpose Driven Life"": ""The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life: the compass I rely on for direction, the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions, and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything.""
